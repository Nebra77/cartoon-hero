        <h2>Relations to other characters</h2>
        <h3>The chosen tarnished</h3>
        <p>When you first join the Roundtable, Gideon does welcome you, but gives you a warning that you must prove your worth in order to stay. You do this by killing your first shardbearer, and 
            Gideon officialy accepts you as a member of the hold. He then imparts apon you knollege about the shardbearers. When you recieve your second great rune, he gains even more faith in you, and instructs
            you to go to the capital city, Leyndell, to the foot of the erdtree. When spoken to about her daughter, he refers to her as if she is nothing more than a tool to be used, even saying to use 
            her if "she has any use for you." After Nepheli confronts his father after he sends agents to massacure the albanuric village, he simply dissowns her, saying that she is no longer of any use. He also 
            tells you to dispose of selevisus potion if you talk to him about it, as they are not on good terms. You can also find out more information on the the consintratd snowfield, mogwyn palace, and the haligetree
            after aquiring certain items. When you burn down the erdtree, and the Roundtable starts to burn with it, he simply says that it has served its purpose in helping a tarnished become lord. However, as you near
            the erdtree, he stops you and enitias combat. Why he does this is partialy up for debate, but you do end up defeating him, with his last words being: "I know...in my bones...
            A Tarnished cannot become a Lord. Not even you. A man cannot kill a god...". Sure, Gideon.
